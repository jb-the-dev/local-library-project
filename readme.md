# Local Library Project

The aim of this project was to build the Javascript functionality for a library's website, accomplished mainly through manipulating objects and arrays through higher order functions. The styling was already in place.

## Reflections
- A big win was being able to create dryer code by implementing a helper function, _sortAndFiveArray(), that was able to be used across three different lists displayed on the home page: Most Common Genres, Most Popular Books, and Most Popular Authors
- Taking the time to understand how to solve for several problems in different ways has proven useful in cementing the understanding of how/when to use higher order functions, including reduce
- Though all the tests are passing and information displays properly on the "Stats by Book" and "Stats by Account" tabs, there currently seems to be a bug with the data rendering on the "Overall Stats" page.
